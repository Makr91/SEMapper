# SEMapper
A tool to map GPS points input in a Discord message board or from a static file. 

Creates a Plotly and Matplotlib index.html file, which can be upload to a website.


To build the tool you will need to be running Python 3.8.


1) git clone https://github.com/Makr91/SEMapper

2) cd SEMapper

3) Edit the conf.yaml file with your Discord Developer Logins and the Factions Name

4) pip3 install -r requirements.txt

5) python3.8 plot.py





Once it is up and running you can then paste any set of stock GPS coordinates from Space engineers and it will map it. 


I have also begun to add support for factions, nations, sectors and other features.
